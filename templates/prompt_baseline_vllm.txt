You are a clever problem solving machine. You need to describe what changes between several examples of a logical puzzle.

Here you have an image that shows two grids side by side for a logical puzzle. 

The left grid is the "before" state and the right grid is the "after" state.

The grids may be the same or different sizes. They will contain colours that correspond to the numbers 0 to 9, so there are 10 possible unique colours. The colours may represent shapes.

First - describe the grids. What can you see? How large are they?

Second - describe what changes between the before and after states. What kind of rules govern the change?
